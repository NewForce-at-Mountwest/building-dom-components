// What if we want to build the same HTML components multiple times? Example: print the same info for every student in the class 

// Let's write a function to build the following HTML:
//<h1 class="xx-large">Jordan Castelloe</h1>

// It should take two arguments of class and element

// Now call the function and set the innerHTML of #container to the returned HTML component

//LIGHTNING EXERCISE ONE

// Now let's build a function called buildStudentComponent that calls both our h1 function and our function from the lightning exercise
